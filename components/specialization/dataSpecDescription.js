      `I started coding before the age of ten.My extensive experience has enabled me to be employed in a wide-range of domains, 
      including 3D modeling, healthcare, and telecommunications.  As a seasoned software expert, 
      I developed products for a number of corporate clients, including, but not limited to, General Electric, Ericsson, and Graphisoft. 
      I also specialize in creating and building test automation frameworks and applications in support of software development and 
      quality assurance processes. I write code. A lot of code. Through my prolonged history writing code, 
      I have learned and perfected a number of skills.As a result, many colleagues have referred to me as a polyglot.`,
      `My main focus in my code-writing experience is back-end development. 
      I have over 10 years of experience in development with Java programming, Spring programming, and Spring Boot.
      I am also extremely experienced in and enthusiastic about CI using 
      Maven, Docker and Jenkins, with particular focus on code quality 
      applying TDD using JUnit4 and JUnit5 and Mocking frameworks such as Mockito, TestNG along with BDD Frameworks
      such as JBehave and Cucumber and API testing with Spring Cloud Contract and RestAssured, 
      or Front-End test automation using Selenium or Cypress.I have always found the most compelling portion of software product development`,
      `to be the customer-facing part of software solutions.  As such, over the past few years, 
      I have expanded my knowledge of an experience in front-end development.  Through hundreds of hours of online coursework, 
      I have greatly enhanced my knowledge of javascript, typescript, html, css and sass, as well as javascript frameworks like ReactJS and NextJS.
      I have found that in gaining this knowledge, I have been able to take my normal, everyday work to the next level 
      in being able to not only deliver APIs or CLI solutions, but aiding end-user UIs as well.`,

      `I have always been an individual who has both strong creative and logical abilities.
      As far back as I can recall, I have drawn to artistic endeavors, starting with drawing landscapes 
      and characters in my childhood.  I also have a strong interest in photography and filmmaking, 
      which go hand in hand with my natural IT inclination and skills so it could be the perfect fit. 
      I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. Being able to not only code a full-stack software solution, 
       but to be able to design the UI as well.`,
      `I have regularly engaged my digital photography skills for the past 10 years using my Canon DSLR camera, 
      utilizing both Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom for image editing and enhancing.  
      This experience has enabled me to create complex digit photo compositions with a specialization in creating unique creations 
      with a fantasy flair. I discovered that my experience in taking and editing 
      digital photographs directly correlates to the field of software development.
      As such, I have learned to apply these skills in UI design, first using Adobe Photoshop in my designs, 
      and then advancing to using Illustrator and Figma.`,
      `I am also a bit experienced in 3D modelling and digital sculpting using Autodesk Maya and Zbrush. On the top of all that, to boost the markting value of my work
      I have started working on video editing and VFX using Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.`,
