        and now it is show time. Let me share some picture with you from my past - cause I dont have any from my future yet &#128516;
        From the very beginning  when I took my first baby-steps, through the years when I started coding before the age of ten, 
        on a computer called Videoton TV computer in Basic language (with tape drive plugged to a Black&White TV ). 
        There came Commodore Plus 4, then Commdore 64 with Blue Chip 5.25 Disk Drive, then the first 
        XT 286 with , and AT 486, and Pentium with CGA and VGA monitors &#128516; wowww, this is a history &#128516; installing windows 3.11 coming on 6 1.44MB 3.5â€³ 
        floppy disc ( my favourite disk brand was "noname" &#128514; ), 
        at that time I got familiar with Quick Basic, Turbo Pascal, and with the big game changer: Delphi &#128516;
        Ohh I am getting old.. but who isnt? &#128514; (Vampires and Christopher Lambert). But aside IT, of course most importantly let me present some insight 
        into my everyday life.
