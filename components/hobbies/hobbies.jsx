          Not a Yet Another Average Software Engineer.
          I'm passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life.
          Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side.
          I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code.    
          I am a Software Test Automation Framework Developer and a Full-stack Engineer with over 19 years of Information Technology related experience. 
          Sometimes I am also get involded in activites such as digital multimedia & ui design, graphic craftsmanship, and team management. 
          I maintain a passion for technology and helping others get the most out of technology by using the appropriate tools, techniques, and strategies to ensure clients satisfaction.
          Regarding the last 4 years I am functioning as a Development Team Lead as well.
